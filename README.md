# OpenCourse
## Trying to make college somewhat more managable.

## Team:

	Nick Zimmer (github: nzimm)
	Bum Kim  (github: bumshakabum)

## Project title:
	OpenCourse

## Project description:
	A mobile and web app that stores and organizes information about current courses. The app will
	contain a schedule for each class, along with storing a copy of the syllabus and other course
	materials made available by the instructor. The users can choose to recieve notifications about
	exam dates, homework due dates, and other relevant information.

## Vision statement: 
	* All of your academics, in one place.
	
## Motivation: for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)
	Having a convenient mobile app which has homework assignments, handouts, and grades for all
	classes will increase productivity. Can integrate the functionality of piazza, moodle, and d2l
	for convinience of instructors and pupils alike.
	
## Risks: to project completion 
	* Most of the team is new to app and web development
	* A scope of a mobile app and a web app could be too broad
	* With 5 collaboraters, communication may prove to be difficult 
	
## Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk
	* Sharing knowledge as we learn will accelerate the learning curve
