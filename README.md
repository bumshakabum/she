Project title:
	OpenCourse

Project description:
	A mobile and web app that keeps stores and organizes information about current courses. The app will contain a schedule for each class, 	along with storing a copy of the syllabus and other course materials made available by the instructor. The users can choose to recieve 	   	 notifications about exam dates, homework due dates, and other relevant information.

Vision statement: (what you would tell potential customers) Be sure to follow the guidelines from lecture!

Motivation: for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)

Risks: to project completion (these could include:

    Working environment or language new to some team members,
    No prior experience working with the people on the team,
    Lack of availability of some needed resource, etc.)


Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk


List of requirements: for the project

    6 user stories
    Each story must have a unique ID number
    Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
    Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
        Agile sizing – story points
        Time estimate to complete

    All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.
    [optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
    [optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
    [optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)


Methodology: Which methodology you plan to follow, though it may change: Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …

Project Tracking software:

    Name of the software you will use
        Trello is most common
        Pivotal Tracker
        Basecamp
        GitHub Issues & Milestones
    Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access
    Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
