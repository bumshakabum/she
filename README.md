# OpenCourse
##Trying to make college somewhat more managable.

## Team: 
	Nischay Murthy (github: nmurthy9)
	Nick Zimmer (github: nzimm)
	Bum Kim  (github: bumshakabum)
	Alex Ubanski
	Michael Neuder (github: michaelneuder)

## Project title:
	OpenCourse

## Project description:
	A mobile and web app that stores and organizes information about current courses. The app will
	contain a schedule for each class, along with storing a copy of the syllabus and other course
	materials made available by the instructor. The users can choose to recieve notifications about
	exam dates, homework due dates, and other relevant information.

## Vision statement: 
	* All of your academics, in one place (feel free to change)
## Motivation: for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)
	Having a convenient mobile app which has homework assignments, handouts, and grades for all
	classes will increase productivity. Can integrate the functionality of piazza, moodle, and d2l
	for convinience of instructors and pupils alike.
## Risks: to project completion 
	* Most of the team is new to app and web development
	* A scope of a mobile app and a web app could be too broad
	* With 5 collaboraters, communication may prove to be difficult 


## Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk
	* Sharing knowledge as we learn will accelerate the learning curve

## List of requirements: for the project

    6 user stories
    Each story must have a unique ID number
    Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
    Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
        Agile sizing – story points
        Time estimate to complete

    All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.
    [optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
    [optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
    [optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)


## Methodology: Which methodology you plan to follow, though it may change: Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …
	We plan on following a mix of Agile and waterfall, so we can better focus on developing particular
	skillsets and applying them to the project.
## Project Tracking software:

    Name of the software you will use
        Trello is most common
        Pivotal Tracker
        *Basecamp
        GitHub Issues & Milestones
    Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access
    Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the methodologies and tools used in industry!
