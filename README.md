## Project title:
	she

## Project description:
	Do you ever get tired of being asked if you are still single? Are your parents waiting anxiously for you to bring someone home? 
	Are your friends pestering you to find someone? Then she is the app for you! This mobile and web app will simulate a
	girlfriend by creating fake social media accounts for our users. The user will recieve photos, texts, phone calls, snapchats, etc.
	from this virtual girlfriend. A trick so convincing everyone will believe that she is real. Take it one step farther and become a 
	premium member to request in person appearances at family events or parties, where other users will pretend to be your significant 
	other. Who knows, maybe you will find a connection!

## Vision statement: 
	To give users the appearance of having a significant other, and provide companionship to them.
	
## Motivation: for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)
	Having a girlfriend without all the hassle of interacting with them in real life.
	
## Risks: to project completion 
	* Most of the team is new to app and web development
	* A scope of a mobile app and a web app could be too broad
	* With 5 collaboraters, communication may prove to be difficult 
	
## Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk
	* Sharing knowledge as we learn will accelerate the learning curve
